Welcome to ChanPy's documentation!
==================================

ChanPy is a CSP Python library based on Clojure core.async. It provides
equivalents for all the functions in
`core.async <https://clojure.github.io/core.async/>`_ and provides channels
that can be used with or without asyncio. ChanPy even provides support for
applying transformations across channels in the same way Clojure does, via
:any:`transducers`.
